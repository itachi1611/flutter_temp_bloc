# Flutter Production Boilerplate

## A flutter project containing flutter\_bloc, flutter\_lints, hive, easy\_localization and more!

This repository is the starting point for collection templates. If you have any suggestions or improvements feel free to let me know. The project strives to implement best practices recommended by Google and other developers. These best practices include but are not limited to:

- Using BLOC & Cubit for state management.
- Using Flutter Lints for stricter linting rules.
- Using Hive for platform independent storage that also works for web.
- Project structure, const constructors, extracted widgets and many more...

## Note

After following the installation steps you can customize your project.

1. Theme

   _You can customize your brand colors in the [lib/config/theme.dart](./lib/common/app_themes.dart) file. The project useses colors from [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors). As primary swatch the indigo color palette is used while for the text the gray color palette is used. Feel free to replace those values with your own. In order to get a smooth transition for the text colors it is necessary to override each text type in the TextTheme._

2. Removing unwanted packages

   _If a package is not listed, then removing it from [pubspec.yaml](./pubspec.yaml) as well as all imports and uses should be enough. This is required for removing every packages, the following instructions are an addition to that._

3. Flutter Lints

   _Delete the [analysis_options.yaml](./analysis_options.yaml) file. As an alternative you can modify the rules in this file or use a different package like [Lint](https://pub.dev/packages/lint)._

4. Url Launcher

   _For iOS go to [ios/Runner/Info.plist](./ios/Runner/Info.plist) and remove the following code:_

    ```
    <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>https</string>
      <string>http</string>
    </array>
    ```

   For Android you can take a look at this [Stackoverflow issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65082750) for more information. Visit [android/app/src/AndroidManifest.xml](./android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) and remove the
   following code:

    ```
    <queries>
         <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <data android:scheme="https" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
    ```
